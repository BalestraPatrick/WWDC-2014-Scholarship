WWDC 2014 Scholarship
=====================

This is my entry for a WWDC 214 Scholarship. It's an iPad app about me!
Code isn't very pretty, but yeah. It's basically a UIScrollView and I calculate the percentage of offSet based on the original position and then animate all the views accordingly.
The background should be a live blur of the front camera. To try this feature, use a real iPad.
